## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m an AI engineer specializing in computer vision solutions built with OpenCV and Python. This project showcases how to build efficient, real-world vision systems with a strong focus on image preprocessing, object detection, and real-time video processing.

A major component of this repository is image preprocessing, which lays the foundation for reliable model performance. I implement techniques such as resizing, normalization, noise reduction, color space transformations, edge detection, and histogram equalization to prepare raw image data for downstream tasks. These preprocessing steps are modular, making them easy to adapt for different datasets and use cases.

The project also features object detection pipelines using both traditional methods (like Haar cascades and contour analysis) and deep learning-based models such as YOLO, SSD, or MobileNet-SSD. These models are integrated using OpenCVâ€™s dnn module or external libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, depending on the application. Detection results are optimized with techniques like non-maximum suppression and confidence thresholding for real-time accuracy.

Another core focus is real-time video processing, where I apply these computer vision models to live video feeds from webcams or IP cameras. The repository includes examples of real-time object tracking, motion detection, and frame-by-frame inference with performance optimizations to maintain smooth frame rates. Efficient buffer handling, multithreading, and GPU acceleration are explored to enhance responsiveness and scalability.

Whether youâ€™re building AI-powered surveillance systems, interactive applications, or just exploring the capabilities of computer vision, this repository offers practical, well-documented examples that demonstrate how to bring visual intelligence into real-time environments.
